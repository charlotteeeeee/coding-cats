  <h1>what about this one?</h1>
  <p class="codecats">Vegetables are fantastic! Letâ€™s make the most of them. We can cut down on our contribution to food waste by: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>using the whole of a vegetable. Including the leaves, ends and skin</li>
    <li>eating them fresh before they go off, if not then freeze them and add them to soup</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We can cut down on wasted plastic by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>choosing to buy loose vegetables rather than pre-packaged</li>
  </ul>
