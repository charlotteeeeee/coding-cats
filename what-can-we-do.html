            <p>Reducing the amount of meat you eat is one of the single greatest ways anyone can contribute to reducing the amount of greenhouse gases they contribute to the emissions of.
              Have you thought about trying <a href="https://www.meatfreemondays.com/"> #MeatFreeMondays</a>? The site contains lots of hints, tips and recipies for reducing the amount of meat you eat!
            <p>Vegetables are fantastic! Let’s make the most of them. We can cut down on our contribution to food waste by: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>using the whole of a vegetable. Including the leaves, ends and skin</li>
              <li>eating them fresh before they go off, if not then freeze them and add them to soup</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We can cut down on wasted plastic by choosing to buy loose vegetables rather than pre-packaged</p>
            <p> <a href="https://gb-beetxbeet.glopalstore.com/pages/awareness-101">Beetxbeex </a> is an online apparel store that focuses on sustainable production as well as raising awareness
              of the impacts of the choices we make every day.  The cite provides information that helps people ease into veganism,
              such as what we’d save from being vegan for a day and ways to acquire protein and calcium on a vegan diet.
            <p>Cut down on products that use unsustainable palm oil so that animals like organgutans don't loose their forest homes.
              You can find out more palm oil and <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/which-everyday-products-contain-palm-oil"> products that contain it </a> </p>
             <p>Most cities have beautiful green spaces. Look after our parks and green places by pick up litter, recycling and respecting
               the wildlife that lives there. What is your favourite
                <a href="https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/green-spaces/Pages/default.aspx"> London green space </a> to visit? </p>
            <p> The <a href="https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/"> Wildlife Trust </a> is a fantastic organisation that focuses on conversation of British animals and habitats. They provide
              lots of information about local nature reserves and animals you can find there! Where is your local reserve?
            <p> TFL is trying to make London a more <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/cycling-revolution-london.pdf"> cyclable city</a>. One person replacing public transport with cycling doesn’t change daily emissions,
              but a movement that could reduce the number of trains will have an impact. It is also a healthier alternative for fitness and budget friendly!
